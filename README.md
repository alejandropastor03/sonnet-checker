# Sonnet checker
Implementation of a sonnet validator in R, using Natural Language Processing techniques, as a project for my NLP course during my second year of university.

The project includes the following tools: 
1. Make a poet.R program that obtains by aguments the name of the file containing a sonnet. The program should indicate whether the sonnet meets the metric.
2. Make a program poeta_interactivo.R that plays with the user, allowing the user to enter verses, and that the program proposes words that meet the metric.
3. Make a program poeta_web.R that analyzes a web page and identifies sonnets contained in the page.
